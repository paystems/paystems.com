    Revenue Recovery in PayStems is designed to act as a failsafe for recurring payments. It intelligently performs retries for failed transactions by analyzing over 20 transaction parameters to determine the best retry strategy. This helps subscription-based businesses reduce involuntary churn, recover lost revenue, and maximize customer lifetime value, all while seamlessly integrating with existing subscription management systems. The setup is straightforward, requiring merchants to configure credentials and webhooks for both payment processors and their subscription platform, and to define a recovery plan.

  title: "Why is Revenue Recovery Important?"
  subTitle: |
    For subscription-based businesses, involuntary churn from failed recurring payments can significantly impact revenue. Payment failures may result from insufficient funds, fraud checks, or issuer restrictions. A simple dunning setup is not effective in retrieving these failed payments. Revenue recovery’s Intelligent retry engine analyzes 20+ transaction parameters to find best retry strategy to recover the given payment.
