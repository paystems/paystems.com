    APM Widgets refer to modular, embeddable alternate payment methods provided via PayStems. These widgets allow merchants to augment their existing checkouts with additional payment options (beyond what their current PSP offers) in a low-code manner. By integrating APM widgets, merchants can add various payment methods such as digital wallets, BNPL, bank transfers, etc., with minimal engineering effort and high customizability, all managed through a single SDK. For instance, a merchant who previously only offered cards or PayPal through their current PSP can now easily enable more payment options using APM widgets, which streamline the integration process by reducing traditional engineering challenges.

    We support modular, embeddable alternate payment methods (APMs) known as APM widgets, which a merchant can use to augment their existing checkout in a low code manner. In case a PSP supports a desired payment method, integrating it into the existing checkout is tedious and often requires high engineering effort. PayStems widets offers a low code solution for such a scenario where a merchant can not only choose to have their preferred payment method through a wide range of connectors, but also integrate it with minimal engineering effort.

  - title: "Availability"
    subTitle: "Current PSP may not support the desired alternate payment method requiring the merchant to do a direct integration or use a different PSP. APM widget offers merchants the flexibility to surface the right set of APMs in the widget based on the order context - Value, Region and more."
  - title: "Complex to integrate"
    subTitle: "In case a PSP supports a desired payment method, integrating it into the existing checkout is tedious and often requires high engineering effort. APM widgets offers a low code solution for such a scenario where a merchant cannot only choose to have their preferred payment method through a wide range of connectors, but also integrate it with minimal engineering effort."
  - title: "Complex to enhance"
    subTitle: "Traditional PSPs and Middle layers ((Subscription provider’s SDK or Token provider’s SDK or Orchestration provider’s SDK)) offer separate integration for every new APM, requiring ongoing engineering effort for enhancements. APM widgets offers a way for merchants to extend APMs from just “Apple Pay” to “Apple Pay + Google Pay” to “Apple Pay + Google Pay + Amazon Pay + 10 more” with the same integration and no additional engineering effort."

  - title: "Context-Aware Payment Selection"
    subTitle: "APM Widgets intelligently surface the most appropriate alternate payment methods based on the order context—such as order value, geographic region, and more—to ensure customers are presented with the best options for their transaction."
  - title: "Low-Code Integration"
    subTitle: "The solution minimizes engineering overhead by providing a low-code framework. This means merchants can add or enhance payment methods without extensive technical effort, streamlining the integration process."
  - title: "Unified SDK Management"
    subTitle: "A single, all-encompassing SDK powers the entire suite of APMs. This unified approach simplifies managing multiple payment methods, reducing the complexity typically associated with integrating various payment service providers."
  - title: "Seamless Multi-Platform Support"
    subTitle: "APM widget is designed to work effortlessly with a variety of tech stacks, including React, HTML, and Angular. This cross-framework compatibility ensures that merchants can integrate intelligent routing without the need for platform-specific adjustments."

  - title: "Dashboard-Driven PSP Configuration"
    subTitle: "Routing transactions through different PSPs is handled via an intuitive dashboard. Merchants can easily add, remove, or reconfigure PSPs and payment methods without revisiting the core integration, keeping operations agile and responsive."
  - title: "Modular and Scalable Payment Options"
    subTitle: "The modular nature of APM Widgets enables merchants to start with a few payment methods and scale up seamlessly. Whether adding one more option or a suite of alternate payment methods, the integration remains consistent and efficient."
  - title: "Interoperability with Multiple Providers"
    subTitle: "APM widget’s design supports the integration of multiple PSPs and middle layers without conflict. This interoperability allows merchants to route transactions flexibly, ensuring they can leverage the best payment service providers available."
  - title: "Unified Analytics and Order Management"
    subTitle: "Every transaction processed through Hyperwidget is captured on a consolidated dashboard. This unified analytics approach enables merchants to drill down into conversion metrics, transaction types, and failure reasons—empowering them to refine their routing strategies and overall payment performance."
