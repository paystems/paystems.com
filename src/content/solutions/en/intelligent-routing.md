    Intelligent Routing is a smart payment routing system that helps businesses choose the best way to process payments by adjusting routing rules in real time. Unlike static routing, which follows fixed rules, Intelligent Routing uses up-to-the-minute data—such as success rates, past transaction patterns, and processor issues. By combining past data with real-time insights, it picks the best processor for each payment. This automation saves businesses from manually updating rules, adapting automatically to current conditions for smoother, more efficient payment processing.

  subTitle: |
    PayStems Smart Router Engine evaluates every payment request against your predefined routing logic and makes a decision on the best payment processor for the payment, and executes the transaction. If the payment fails or if the payment processor is down, the payment is automatically retried through a different processor.

descriptionList:
  - title: "Rule Based Routing"
    subTitle: "This configuration lets you define granular rules based on payment parameters such as payment method, amount, currency, and more. Each rule is associated with a processor preference and conditions. The rules are evaluated sequentially, and if a condition is met, the corresponding processor (or processor combination with split or fallback options) is used for the transaction."
  - title: "Volume Based Routing"
    subTitle: "This routing determines processor selection based on a predefined volume distribution among multiple processors using percentages."
  - title: "Smart/Intelligent Routing"
    subTitle: "This approach leverages real-time data—such as success rates, historical transaction patterns, and processor issues—to automatically choose the best processor for each payment. It also includes fallback support for seamless payment processing in case of failures or outages."

  - title: "Real-Time Data-Driven Decisions"
    subTitle: "Intelligent Routing leverages up-to-the-minute data—such as current success rates, historical transaction patterns, and processor issues—to select the most optimal payment processor for each transaction."
  - title: "Boosted Conversion Rates"
    subTitle: "By dynamically directing payments to processors with higher approval rates (for example, routing specific card types to the processor that approves them most often), Intelligent Routing helps increase overall conversion rates."
  - title: "Regional Optimization"
    subTitle: "For global businesses, the system routes payments to processors that perform best in each region. This means using processors with strong local connectivity (e.g., European processors for EU payments and U.S. processors for U.S. payments) to enhance processing efficiency."
  - title: "Volume Commitment Compliance"
    subTitle: "The system tracks the transaction volume requirements set in processor contracts and intelligently distributes payments to ensure these commitments are met while still optimizing for success rates."
specificationsRight:
  - title: "Real-Time Outage Handling"
    subTitle: "If a payment processor encounters downtime or issues, Intelligent Routing automatically detects the problem and reroutes payments to stable processors, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted payment processing."
  - title: "Automated Rule Adjustments"
    subTitle: "Unlike static routing that follows fixed rules, Intelligent Routing continuously updates its routing logic based on real-time insights and past performance, eliminating the need for manual rule updates."
  - title: "Fallback and Redundancy"
    subTitle: "Built-in fallback support ensures that if a transaction fails or the chosen processor is down, the system automatically retries the payment using an alternate processor, maintaining seamless payment operations."
  - title: "Flexible Routing Configurations"
    subTitle: "Intelligent Routing supports multiple configurations—such as rule-based, volume-based, cost-based, and default fallback routing—providing businesses with a no-code tool for complete control, transparency, and customization of their payment processing strategy"
