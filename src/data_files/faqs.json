      "question": "What is PayStems and how does it simplify payment operations?",
      "answer": "PayStems is a payment orchestration platform for online businesses and payment institutions. We are a Technology Service Provider (TSP) to merchants, not a payments intermediary. As a TSP, PayStems provides software for seamless checkout, routing, analytics, tokenization, and authentication, fully compliant with payment industry standards. When merchants partner with us, our technology seamlessly integrates into their tech stack, and our team functions as an extension of theirs. The business relationship involves merchants and the PA for payment processing and settlement, while merchants engage separately with PayStems for payment orchestration. Merchants can continue using the software of their choice and we are open to any further customizations, in this regard, based on merchant feedback."
